<h1>COMAP 2023</h1>
<br>
This is the repository containing all the code for my team's entry to the 2023 mathematical modeling competition.
<br>
We worked on problem D.
<br>
The bulk of the project is a weighted graph with vertices associated with each goal; this network is then used to
calculate the achievement scores and priorities of each goal. The results are then visualized using a MATLAB script.
